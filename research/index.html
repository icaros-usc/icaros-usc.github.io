The difference between capacity for use and actual spontaneous use is referred to as arm nonuse. Obtaining an ecologically valid evaluation of arm nonuse is challenging because it requires the observation of spontaneous arm choice for different tasks, which can easily be influenced by instructions, presumed expectations, and awareness that one is being tested. To better quantify arm nonuse, we developed the bimanual arm reaching test with a robot (BARTR) for quantitatively assessing arm nonuse in chronic stroke survivors. The BARTR is an instrument that uses a robot arm as a means of remote and unbiased data collection of nuanced spatial data for clinical evaluations of arm nonuse. This approach shows promise for determining the efficacy of interventions designed to reduce paretic arm nonuse and enhance functional recovery after stroke. We show that the BARTR satisfies the criteria of an appropriate metric for neurorehabilitative contexts: It is valid, reliable, and simple to use. Interacting with a robot can quantify otherwise hard-to-measure clinical metrics.</p></div></details></div></div></div><div class="w-full lg:w-1/2"><div class="w-full border-gray-100 border-t-2 hover:bg-gray-100 p-3"><p class="text-black block font-bold">Transfer learning of human preferences for proactive robot assistance in assembly tasks</p><p class="text-gray-600 text-base">H.

Much work on robot adaptation requires human demonstrations of the task. However, human demonstrations of real-world assemblies can be tedious and time-consuming. Thus, we propose learning human preferences from demonstrations in a shorter, canonical task to predict user actions in the actual assembly task. The proposed system uses the preference model learned from the canonical task as a prior and updates the model through interaction when predictions are inaccurate. We evaluate the proposed system in simulated assembly tasks and in a real-world human-robot assembly study and we show that both transferring the preference model from the canonical task, as well as updating the model online, contribute to improved accuracy in human action prediction. This enables the robot to proactively assist users, significantly reduce their idle time, and improve their experience working with the robot, compared to a reactive robot.</p></div></details></div></div></div><div class="w-full lg:w-1/2"><div class="w-full border-gray-100 border-t-2 hover:bg-gray-100 p-3"><p class="text-black block font-bold">Learning performance graphs from demonstrations via task-based evaluations</p><p class="text-gray-600 text-base">A.

Without this knowledge, a robot may infer incorrect reward functions that lead to undesirable or unsafe control policies. Prior work has used temporal logic specifications, manually ranked by human experts based on their importance, to learn reward functions from imperfect/suboptimal demonstrations. To overcome reliance on expert rankings, we propose a novel algorithm that learns from demonstrations, a partial ordering of provided specifications in the form of a performance graph. Through various experiments, including simulation of industrial mobile robots, we show that extracting reward functions with the learned graph results in robot policies similar to those generated with the manually specified orderings. We also show in a user study that the learned orderings match the orderings or rankings by participants for demonstrations in a simulated driving domain. These results show that we can accurately evaluate demonstrations with respect to provided task specifications from a small set of imperfect data with minimal expert input.</p></div></details></div></div></div><div class="w-full lg:w-1/2"><div class="w-full border-gray-100 border-t-2 hover:bg-gray-100 p-3"><p class="text-black block font-bold">Towards transferring human preferences from canonical to actual assembly tasks</p><p class="text-gray-600 text-base">H.

Our thesis is that we can learn user preferences in assembly tasks from demonstrations in a representative canonical task. Inspired by previous work in economy of human movement, we propose to represent user preferences as a linear function of abstract task-agnostic features, such as movement and physical and mental effort required by the user. For each user, we learn their preference from demonstrations in a canonical task and use the learned preference to anticipate their actions in the actual assembly task without any user demonstrations in the actual task. We evaluate our proposed method in a model-airplane assembly study and show that preferences can be effectively transferred from canonical to actual assembly tasks, enabling robots to anticipate user actions.</p></div></details></div></div></div><div class="w-full lg:w-1/2"><div class="w-full border-gray-100 border-t-2 hover:bg-gray-100 p-3"><p class="text-black block font-bold">Design and Evaluation of a Hair Combing System Using a General-Purpose Robotic Arm</p><p class="text-gray-600 text-base">N.

The first component is the segmentation module, which segments the location of hair in space. The second component is the path planning module that proposes automatically-generated paths through hair based on user input. The final component creates a trajectory for the robot to execute. We quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the paths planned by the system with 48 users and qualitatively evaluate the system with 30 users watching videos of the robot performing a hair-combing task in the physical world.

Previous work has focused on learning the dominant preferences of human workers for simple tasks largely based on their intended goal. However, people may have preferences at different resolutions: they may share the same high-level preference for the order of the sub-tasks but differ in the sequence of individual actions. We propose a two-stage approach for learning and inferring the preferences of human operators based on the sequence of sub-tasks and actions. We conduct an IKEA assembly study and demonstrate how our approach is able to learn the dominant preferences in a complex task. We show that our approach improves the prediction of human actions through cross-validation. Lastly, we show that our two-stage approach improves the efficiency of task execution in an online experiment, and demonstrate its applicability in a real-world robot-assisted IKEA assembly.</p></div></details></div></div></div><div class="w-full lg:w-1/2"><div class="w-full border-gray-100 border-t-2 hover:bg-gray-100 p-3"><p class="text-black block font-bold">Personalizing User Engagement Dynamics in a Non-Verbal Communication Game for Cerebral Palsy</p><p class="text-gray-600 text-base">N.

We adapt model predictive control to account for planning latency, which allows the learned model to be used for real time control. Additionally, to ensure safe exploration during model learning, we embed prior knowledge of leg trajectories into the action space. The resulting system achieves fast and robust locomotion. Unlike model-free methods, which optimize for a particular task, our planner can use the same learned dynamics for various tasks, simply by changing the reward function.1 To the best of our knowledge, our approach is more than an order of magnitude more sample efficient than current model-free methods.</p></div></details></div></div></div></div></div><div class="max-w-none prose mb-4 mt-8"><h2 id="research-contribution-%232%3A-automatic-scenario-generation">Research Contribution #2: Automatic Scenario Generation <a class="permalink" href="#research-contribution-%232%3A-automatic-scenario-generation">¶</a></h2></div><div class="flex flex-wrap items-center"><div class="w-full lg:w-7/12 max-w-none prose"><p>For HRI systems to be widely accepted and used, they need to perform robustly in human environments. Traditionally, human-robot interaction (HRI) algorithms are tested with human subject experiments. While these experiments are fundamental in exploring and evaluating human-robot interactions and can lead to exciting and unpredictable behaviors, they are often limited in the number of environments and human actions that they can cover. Exhaustive search of human actions and environments is also computationally prohibitive. This highlights a critical need for automatically generating HRI scenarios; failure to do so can lead to infrequent scenarios that are undiscovered during testing but occur in large-scale real-world deployments, resulting in potentially costly failures.</p><p>Our goal is to find scenarios that are diverse, complex and realistic. Our insight is to formulate this as a quality diversity problem, where the goal is to generate scenarios that are diverse with respect to specific measures of interest.

To this end, previous methods have algorithmically generated diverse scenarios that reveal system failures in a shared control teleoperation task. However, these methods require directly evaluating generated scenarios by simulating robot policies and human actions. The computational cost of these evaluations limits their applicability in more complex domains. Thus, we propose augmenting scenario generation systems with surrogate models that predict both human and robot behaviors.

While GAN generated levels are stylistically similar to human-authored examples, human designers often want to explore the generative design space of GANs to extract interesting levels. However, human designers find latent vectors opaque and would rather explore along dimensions the designer specifies, such as number of enemies or obstacles. We propose using state-of-the-art quality diversity algorithms designed to optimize continuous spaces, i.e. MAP-Elites with a directional variation operator and Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites, to efficiently explore the latent space of a GAN to extract levels that vary across a set of specified gameplay measures. In the benchmark domain of Super Mario Bros, we demonstrate how designers may specify gameplay measures to our system and extract high-quality (playable) levels with a diverse range of level mechanics, while still maintaining stylistic similarity to human authored examples. An online user study shows how the different mechanics of the automatically generated levels affect subjective ratings of their perceived difficulty and appearance.</p></div></details></div></div></div><div class="w-full lg:w-1/2"><div class="w-full border-gray-100 border-t-2 hover:bg-gray-100 p-3"><p class="text-black block font-bold">Video Game Level Repair via Mixed Integer Linear Programming</p><p class="text-gray-600 text-base">H.

The framework constructs levels using a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained with human-authored examples and repairs them using a mixed-integer linear program (MIP) with playability constraints. A key component of the framework is computing minimum cost edits between the GAN generated level and the solution of the MIP solver, which we cast as a minimum cost network flow problem.

We focus on a class of stochastic optimization algorithms, named quality diversity (QD) algorithms, which search for a range of high-quality solutions that are diverse with respect to measures of interest. Current state-of-the-art QD algorithms find new solutions by perturbing existing high-quality solutions with Gaussian noise, or through variation operators that exploit local correlations.

To grow further, we believe the QD community faces two challenges: developing a framework to represent the field's growing array of algorithms, and implementing that framework in software that supports a range of researchers and practitioners. To address these challenges, we have developed pyribs, a library built on a highly modular conceptual QD framework. By replacing components in the conceptual framework, and hence in pyribs, users can compose algorithms from across the QD literature; equally important, they can identify unexplored algorithm variations. Furthermore, pyribs makes this framework simple, flexible, and accessible, with a user-friendly API supported by extensive documentation and tutorials. This paper overviews the creation of pyribs, focusing on the conceptual framework that it implements and the design principles that have guided the library's development.</p></div></details></div></div></div><div class="w-full lg:w-1/2"><div class="w-full border-gray-100 border-t-2 hover:bg-gray-100 p-3"><p class="text-black block font-bold">Approximating Gradients for Differentiable Quality Diversity in Reinforcement Learning</p><p class="text-gray-600 text-base">B.

To approach this task, we can train a collection of policies and have the agent select a suitable policy when damaged. Training this collection may be viewed as a quality diversity (QD) optimization problem, where we search for solutions (policies) which maximize an objective (walking forward) while spanning a set of measures (measurable characteristics). Recent work shows that differentiable quality diversity (DQD) algorithms greatly accelerate QD optimization when exact gradients are available for the objective and measures. However, such gradients are typically unavailable in RL settings due to non-differentiable environments. To apply DQD in RL settings, we propose to approximate objective and measure gradients with evolution strategies and actor-critic methods. We develop two variants of the DQD algorithm CMA-MEGA, each with different gradient approximations, and evaluate them on four simulated walking tasks. One variant achieves comparable performance (QD score) with the state-of-the-art PGA-MAP-Elites in two tasks. The other variant performs comparably in all tasks but is less efficient than PGA-MAP-Elites in two tasks. These results provide insight into the limitations of CMA-MEGA in domains that require rigorous optimization of the objective and where exact gradients are unavailable.</p></div></details></div></div></div><div class="w-full lg:w-1/2"><div class="w-full border-gray-100 border-t-2 hover:bg-gray-100 p-3"><p class="text-black block font-bold">Differentiable Quality Diversity</p><p class="text-gray-600 text-base">M.

While quality diversity (QD) algorithms like Novelty Search with Local Competition (NSLC) and MAP-Elites are designed to generate a diverse range of solutions, these algorithms require a large number of evaluations for exploration of continuous spaces. Meanwhile, variants of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) are among the best-performing derivative-free optimizers in single-objective continuous domains. This paper proposes a new QD algorithm called Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME). Our new algorithm combines the self-adaptation techniques of CMA-ES with archiving and mapping techniques for maintaining diversity in QD. Results from experiments based on standard continuous optimization benchmarks show that CMA-ME finds better-quality solutions than MAP-Elites; similarly, results on the strategic game Hearthstone show that CMA-ME finds both a higher overall quality and broader diversity of strategies than both CMA-ES and MAP-Elites. Overall, CMA-ME more than doubles the performance of MAP-Elites using standard QD performance metrics. These results suggest that QD algorithms augmented by operators from state-of-the-art optimization algorithms can yield high-performing methods for simultaneously exploring and optimizing continuous search spaces, with significant applications to design, testing, and reinforcement learning among other domains.</p></div></details></div></div></div></div></div></div></main></div><div class="flex-grow"></div><footer><div class="w-full text-center bg-gray-100 p-6"><div class="mx-auto max-w-screen-2xl"><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-center mx-auto"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUuIwdCu3yXZBv-KtPS5TvQ" title="YouTube" class="flex items-center bg-white h-12 hover:bg-gray-200 hover:no-underline justify-center mx-1 rounded-full shadow-md text-2xl w-12" style="color:#f51d03"><i class="fab mx-auto fa-youtube"></i> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/icaroslab" title="Twitter (@icaroslab)" class="flex items-center bg-white h-12 hover:bg-gray-200 hover:no-underline justify-center mx-1 rounded-full shadow-md text-2xl w-12" style="color:#2f9bf0"><i class="fab mx-auto fa-twitter"></i> </a><a href="https://github.com/icaros-usc/" title="GitHub (icaros-usc)" class="flex items-center bg-white h-12 hover:bg-gray-200 hover:no-underline justify-center mx-1 rounded-full shadow-md text-2xl w-12" style="color:#000"><i class="fab fa-github mx-auto"></i> </a><a href="mailto:nikolaid@usc.edu" title="Email (nikolaid@usc.edu)" class="flex items-center bg-white h-12 hover:bg-gray-200 hover:no-underline justify-center mx-1 rounded-full shadow-md text-2xl w-12" style="color:#5f5f5f"><i class="fas fa-envelope mx-auto"></i></a></div><div class="w-full flex flex-wrap justify-center md:flex-nowrap pt-3 text-black"><p class="w-full md:w-auto md:order-1 order-3">© ICAROS Lab 2019-2024</p><p class="hidden md:inline px-1 order-2">|</p><p class="w-full md:w-auto md:order-3 order-5">In memory of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jignesh-modi-7819a8b8">Jignesh</a></p><p class="hidden md:inline px-1 order-4">|</p><p class="w-full md:w-auto mb-1 md:mb-0 md:order-5 order-1">See anything wrong? <a href="https://github.com/icaros-usc/icaros-usc.github.io/issues/new/">Raise an Issue</a></p></div></div></div></footer><script src="/assets/main.js?ec92d462df2a254c6f079aae6d459857"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/clipboard@2.0.6/dist/clipboard.min.js"></script><script>new ClipboardJS(".clipboard")</script></body></html>
