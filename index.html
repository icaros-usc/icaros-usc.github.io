            <h3> Call for Submissions to Mental Models of Robots Workshop 2020 (Half-day)</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">People often hold inaccurate or overly presumptuous mental models about robots, likely due to a lack of experience and the strong influence of robot design (e.g., appearance). Thus, there is often a mismatch between user mental models, or expectations of robots, and actual robot capabilities. This mismatch can lead to ambiguous perceptions and improper trust estimations of robot actions, wrongful accusations of errors, ineffective human-robot collaboration, or even discontinued use. As robotic systems become increasingly complex and their presence more commonplace, HRI researchers should find ways to give users a window into what the robot is “thinking”, “feeling”, and “intending”. We envision a future in which robots can
            automatically detect and correct inaccurate mental models held by users. This workshop will develop a multidisciplinary vision for the next few years of research in pursuit of that future.</p>
            
            <p class="text-justify">This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in helping users understand robotic systems. Our aim is to create a clearer picture of what mental model research looks like, what the different sub-areas and problems are, and how different disciplines can contribute to making robot actions more interpretable. In this light, we welcome interdisciplinary contributions from those working on estimating aspects of users’ mental models, designing communicative robot actions or other interventions, and developing decision making systems that connect all these elements to create autonomous robot behavior. </p>
            
            <p class="text-justify">Please send submissions directly to Matt Rueben: <a href="mailto:mental.models.in.hri.workshop.2019@gmail.com">mental.models.in.hri.workshop.2019@gmail.com</a></p>
